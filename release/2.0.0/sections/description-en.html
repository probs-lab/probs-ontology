<p>
    The data model proposed [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>] describes three components of a data point: value, metadata, and "system location".
    The value can be a simple numerical value with associated physical units, or could account for uncertain values by defining probability distributions or bounds.
    The metadata includes provenance information.
    The system location is the component specific to MEFA: it associates the data point with its context.
</p>

<p>
    To represent this, we introduce the concept of an <em>Observation</em> to represent an individual data point and its value, linked to its system location.
    We then introduce concepts describing types of materials/goods, and how they are related.
    Full details are available below and in [<a href="#ref-2">2</a>].

<p>
    It is worth noting that the ontology links to several external vocabularies:
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o">PROV</a> for data provenance,
    <a href="http://qudt.org">QUDT</a> for physical units,
    <a href="https://www.geonames.org/ontology">GeoNames</a> for spatial regions,
    and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time">OWL-Time</a> for time.
