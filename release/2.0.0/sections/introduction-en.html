        The core conceptual model is consistent with the <em>bipartite directed graphs</em> described by [<a href="#ref-1">1</a>]:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                A <em>Process</em> is where events/transformations happen.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The things going in and out are <em>Objects</em> (taken broadly, to include goods, materials, energy, and services).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                A <em>flow</em> is the movement of an object in or out of a process.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        A material flow system consists of a set of processes within a boundary, defined in both space and time.
