# Composition and equivalence

Although it would be convenient if all data about a {doc}`system` was published according to a consistent and well-defined classification system, in practice this is rarely the case. Different data sources use different terms to describe the {term}`Object`s and {term}`Process`es their data is referring to. 

Object properties:

```{glossary}
objectEquivalentTo
  Relation which connects two {term}`Object`s which describe exactly the same thing. Example: `Cement :objectEquivalentTo CementInCOMTRADE`.

objectComposedOf
  Relation which connects an {term}`Object` to sub-objects lower in the hierarchy.

processEquivalentTo
  Relation which connects two {term}`Process`es which describe exactly the same thing.

processComposedOf
  Relation which connects a {term}`Process` to sub-processes lower in the hierarchy.
```
