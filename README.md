# PRObs ontology

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5052738.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5052738)

This repository contains the "Physical Resources Observatory" (PRObs) ontology. It includes definitions of the concepts and relations as an OWL ontology in TTL format, as well as a version converted to Datalog rules and RDF data designed to be run with the [RDFox triple store](https://www.oxfordsemantic.tech/product). 

This ontology is being developed as part of [UK FIRES](https://ukfires.org).

## Getting started

See the [documentation](https://probs-ontology.netlify.app/) for more information about the ontology concepts and how it can be used.

You can obtain a copy of the ontology files from this git repository. For use with the PRObs data pipeline see [probs-module-ontology-conversion](https://github.com/probs-lab/probs-module-ontology-conversion).

[TODO: update this example for v2 -- See [probs-ontology-example](https://github.com/ukfires/probs-ontology-example/) for a practical example of using the PRObs system to access resource data.]

## Contributing üéÅ

Contributions are welcome: share examples of work done using the ontology, make suggestions for improving the documentation, and examples of things that are more difficult than they should be or don't work -- as well as of course making actual fixes to the definitions, scripts and documentation.

See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md) for more information
